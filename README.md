File has the Load, Save and Exit choices.
You are able to add students, lessons and enrollment info from text (.txt) files on your computer.
The text files layout should be like:
Name,Lastname,Student Code, Semester (for students)
Lesson, Lesson Code, Semester (for lessons)
Student Code, Lesson Code, Grade (for enroll)

Also you can save this into another text file by adding some more info.

In the Student menu area you have the following choices Add Student, Student/Lesson enroll, Show Student by Student Code and Delete Student.
In the Lesson menu arre the choices are Add Lesson, Show Students Performance for a specific Lesson, find available Lessons for a specifc Semester and Delete Lesson.

This was my semester project.
Sorry for some Greek names or values.
